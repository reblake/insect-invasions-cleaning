# insectcleanr

The goal of insectcleanr is to provide functions for building cleaned data tables of insect data.  This code package was developed for internal use by a SESYNC pursuit team and SESYNC data science staff. 

## Installation

You can install the latest version of insectcleanr from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("reblake/insectcleanr")
```
## Example

Example data in this package is courtesy of 
Morimoto, N., Kiritani, K., Yamamura, K., & Yamanaka, T. (2019). Finding indications of lag time, saturation and trading inflow in the emergence record of exotic agricultural insect pests in Japan. Applied Entomology and Zoology, 54(4), 437-450.

This is a basic example which shows you how to get accepted taxonomies for insect taxa from GBIF.   

```{r example}
library(insectcleanr)

# list the path(s) to your raw data files (your path will look different than this)
# file_list <- system.file("extdata", "Japan_taxa.csv", package = "insectcleanr")

# read in raw data and separate out taxonomic information
# taxa_list <- lapply(file_list, separate_taxonomy) %>% 
#              purrr::reduce(full_join) %>%  # join list of dataframes into one dataframe
#              distinct(genus_species) %>%  # get unique taxa names
#              select(genus_species) %>%  # select only the column with taxa names
#              unlist(., use.names = FALSE)  # make taxa names into a vector   
              
# get accepted taxonomic information from GBIF
# taxa_accepted <- lapply(taxa_list, get_accepted_taxonomy)

```

More details are in the vignette for making the taxonomy table. 


What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
#summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub!
